# 3CX
A collection of PowerShell Scripts that can help automate things in 3CX.


The scripts contained in this collection are free to use at your own risk. They are designed to provide some inspiration on how some level of automation can be achieved within 3CX using the web API.

Note: this is not a documented API!
I am not responsible for any damage running the script may cause. you should always have a current (tested) backup.

I hope these come in handy, feel free to add to these and share any others you have created.
